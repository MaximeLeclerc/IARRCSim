# helps the client gather information from the simulator's installation and configuration directly 
# when the simulation server is on the same computer as the Java-based client.
# if this sim-install property is specified properly, there is no need to specify docserver-host, or docserver-port.

sim-install = c:\Files\StartProgramming\funding\robotics competition\IARRC Simulator project\IARRC_sim\bin\Release
# if this is configured to run on the same computer as the simulator, it is recommended that no other properties be set.
# Not setting properties that can be derived from the installation directory reduces data redundancy.

# here is some information to use if unable to open the installation folder files

# What host is the simulator running on?
# If on the same machine, 127.0.0.1 and localhost are both acceptable.
# default is localhost.
# docserver-host = localhost

# What port is the simulator server running on?
# By default, docserver-port is 2600 
# It is gathered from the simulator's install directory, if that is set properly.
# docserver-port = 2600
